6. **Verify Connectivity**:
    - Test the connection from a remote user endpoint to ensure proper setup.

### Establishing a Secure Connection

#### Remote User and Security Gateway Connection Process
A VPN tunnel is established to allow users to access network resources protected by a Security Gateway. The IKE negotiation process takes place between the peers, during which:

- The identities of both peers are authenticated using methods such as digital certificates issued by an Internal Certificate Authority (ICA) or third-party PKI solutions.
- Once the IKE negotiation is completed, a secure VPN tunnel is created between the client and the Security Gateway.
- All subsequent communications are encrypted using the IPsec standard, ensuring secure data transfer.

#### Standard Remote Access VPN Workflow
1. Enable and configure the Security Gateway for remote access VPN connections.
2. Add remote user details to the Security Management Server.
3. Define firewall access control and encryption rules.
4. Create an LDAP group or user group object for firewall policies.
5. Configure and deploy encryption settings for the VPN community object.
